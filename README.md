# color-cloud

<done>
  - airplane flies in a straight line
  - cloud follows the plane and changes its size
  - airplane appears randomly if it goes out of the screen
  - clouds appear with different color palette if the plane goes out of the screen

<to do>
  - airplane reacts to mouse click event
  - change airplane's shape (to use texture, another shader should be used; making its shape with triangles might work too)
